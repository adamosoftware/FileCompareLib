# FileCompareLib

A while back I wanted to develop my own version control system. I studied some published diff algorithms, but I couldn't make sense of them, honestly. I did it on my own, and I got the core of it working pretty much, although I got stumped on aspects of the visual presentation -- this turns out to be hard in diff applications. I'm no longer working on this, but I just wanted to put it out there.

The meat of it is the **FileCompareLib** project. See the [FileDiff](https://github.com/adamosoftware/FileCompareLib/blob/master/FileCompareLib/FileDiff.cs) and [StringDiff](https://github.com/adamosoftware/FileCompareLib/blob/master/FileCompareLib/StringDiff.cs) source files.
